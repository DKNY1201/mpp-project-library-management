Our team has done 4 main use case and 3 extra credit use cases.

Extra credit use cases:

- Add a book to the library collection: this feature allows administrator add new book by filling a form with necessary fields ISBN, title, 
number of copies, maximum checkout length (use ComboBox with 2 options: 21 and 7), authors. In order to set authors user can select by check boxes 
in a table view which show author list. If user want to add new authors which is not existing in Data Storage, user can use a Add new author form.

- Print member's checkout report: this feature allows librarian search for a library member by ID, and then print the checkout record in the console
with aligned columns.

- Check overdue book: this feature allows librarian search for a book by ISBN which due date is before today and the status of the copy is "not available".

Some additional things:

- Allow to see all information of Books in Table View.
- Allow to see all information of Library Members in Table View.
- Can edit Library Member information by click on the Edit button on Table View (when view all Library Members).
- Validation data for all forms by show Alerts.
- Show the Authentication level of current login user.
- Show message when user complete any action (E.g: Add new member successful, Checkout book successful...)
- Nice and clean design.
